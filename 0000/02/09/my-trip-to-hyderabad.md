<span style="font-size: 4em; font-weight: bold">✨ My Trip to Hyderabad ✨</span>

Notes:

I hope the organizers aren't starting to regret giving me an hour to pontificate on whatever I want at this point, but hopefully it'll be entertaining.

Notes:

Obviously going to conferences isn't all fun and games and Hyderabad is 18 hours away. I wouldn't want to miss out on that experience!

You can't see it here, but since I do have a 2-year-old in my house, I was able to accurately simulate the experience of a toddler on the plane screaming and kicking the back of your seat as well.

     Delicious! Plus it only took 4 minutes to cook!

Notes:

Once I landed in Hyderabad, obviously the first thing to do was to get a biryani, since everyone keeps telling me how great it is. Gotta say, I love that authentic biryani taste. Plus, (advance to second image), it's nice that they only take 4 minutes to cook!

Notes:

Now I'm not much of a sports guy, but I figured the best way to fit in with the locals would be to watch a cricket match. Unfortunately, those games are just too long for me. (Advance to second image) Couldn't quiiiite make it through a whole match.

     Had to substitute some ingredients, though...
 </div>

 Notes:

Of course, I've been told that Hyderabad is called the City of Nawabs and Kebabs, so you know food is going to feature prominently in any good conference, so I thought I'd make some famous Hyderabadi haleem.

Of course, I didn't have exactly have all the right ingredients or like... a recipe, so I had to get a little creative, but based on a google image search, I'm pretty sure my version is pretty close to what I would have gotten in Hyderabad. Pretty good!

Well, with those experiences under my belt, I feel like I'm now adequately prepared to talk about, you know, programming and stuff.
