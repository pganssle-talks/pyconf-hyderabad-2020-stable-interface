Notes:

That brings me to the end of the talk, and usually at the end of a talk I like to reflect a little bit about the lessons learned.

I think the biggest lesson I learned when putting this talk together, when trying to take my thoughts and put them into words and meaningful concepts was the importance of humility.

Humility before your users, trying to explain that they have a valid perspective. And humility about the limits of your ability to design things.

When looking at the task of designing something that is going to work for a hundred thousand or a million or ten million people — something that may need to run on desktop computers supercomputers, microcontrollers, on every continent on Earth and even possibly in space — I think the right reaction to that is view that with some sense of awe. This is not an easy thing to do, and no one could possibly get it right from the start. Even the greatest successes are littered with failures small and large.

Still, I'd like to temper this with some hope, because people have been plagued by this problem for as long as there have been interfaces, and we somehow make do. It's something to be aware of, but it shouldn't paralyze you.

And now I'm sure you want to know what's up with the monkey picture. Wracking your brain for how it could be a metaphor for something? Does the monkey represent an earlier version of humanity or something? Maybe his thoughtful gaze means reflection?

NOPE! He's just a tricky monkey! Look at his little face, he's so happy to have tricked you into thinking he's a metaphor. Sly little devil.

Notes:

Ok, that's my time!

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have, and I'm happy to continue the discussion in other venues — both in the virtual conference hall or on social media like twitter, but before I do any of that I want to sincerely thank the organizers for inviting me to speak, and to thank you all for coming to watch my keynote.
