     alt="HN Comment, text reads: Python Packaging is not hard anymore \n Would you tell us which is the 'right way to do it' nowadays? Possibly, in a maintainable, kind-of-officially supported way that doesn't change or disappear in a few months? \n Please noteâ€‹: I use Python professionally since 2005, I've been involved in a lot of Python packaging for production apps (including giving some talks on the bad state of Python packaging at Europython around 2010) and I had followed closely the then-failed distutils2 effort. And I still don't know what's the 'right and easy way to do it'."

Hopefully, I didn't learn setup.cfg or pyproject.toml new things, since it seems like the latest hype packaging project is deprecated 6 months later :-)"
