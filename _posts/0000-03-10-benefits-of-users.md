<img src="images/setuptools-obscure-bug.png"
     alt="An comment on setuptools issue #2129 from jaraco. The text reads: This might be a contender for one of the most obscure bugs I've seen. Not only does it depend on the fact that your last name begins with 'egg' but it also depends on the fact that the egg-prefixed name appears in the last segment of the pathname, and it depends on the fact that you're on Windows, which provides compatibility with the decades-old 8.3 convention. I suspect there's another factor at play too that's causing the 8.3 filename to be used instead of the proper full filename."/>

     alt="bugs.python.org issue #1875, wherein if 0: return outside of a function does not raise a SyntaxError"
     />

```python
>>> def f():
...     if 0:
...         break  # This is a syntax error!
...     print("Hello")
... 
>>> f()
Hello
```

<img src="images/bpo-35364-fromtimestamp-ignores-inheritance.png"
     alt="bugs.python.org issue #35364, wherein fromtimestamp() ignores inheritance if the time zone specified is not None"
     />


Notes:

- Requires user to have subclassed `datetime.datetime`
- Happens because:
    - `.fromutc()` uses datetime artihmetic
    - datetime arithmetic (used to) always return `datetime.datetime`, even in subclasses
