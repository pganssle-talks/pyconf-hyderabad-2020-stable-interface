Notes:

Hi everyone! Welcome to my talk!

As the slide says, I'm Paul Ganssle. I'm a software engineer at Google and a contributor to many open source projects. Among other things, I maintain dateutil and setuptools, and I'm a core developer of the Python language, where much of my work has been focused on the `datetime` module (and now, the `zoneinfo` module).

Today I'm going to talk about what I'm calling the Stable Interface Paradox, which is something that I think comes up a lot with big, popular projects like the ones I work on, but as you'll see, it's a problem that first manifests *before* you library, application or API endpoint gets popular.

But before we get into all that, I thought I'd take a moment to appreciate the fact that I'm giving this talk. See, this is actually my first keynote! I was thrilled and flattered when the organizers asked me to speak at the conference, and I'm really excited to share this experience with you.

Thing is, though, I'm still a little sad that this didn't involve actually visiting Hyderabad, so I'd start by recreating the experience at home.
