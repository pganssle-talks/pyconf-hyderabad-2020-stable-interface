# The Stable Interface Paradox

The smaller the user base, the harder it is to design an appropriate interface, but the larger the user base, the harder it is to change your interface.

Notes:

Which brings us back to the nominal subject of the talk. The smaller your user base, the harder it is to know what your interface should look like, but the larger your user base, the harder it is to change your interface. It's a catch-22: you can't know what your final product should look like before you get it in front of your customers, but once you've got it in front of them, you can't change it!

Notes:

And of course, what kind of keynote speaker would I be without producing at least one graph with what I'm calling "thought leader axes" — also known as "CEO axes" or "Apple plots" — where the y axis is unlabeled and there are no numbers on the graph anywhere.


But still I do think it's useful to see the principle illustrated — even if the shapes of these curves aren't quite right, I think the general trend is right. You understanding of your problem domain increases as you have more and more users willing to give you feedback about how your product is used in a diverse array of circumstances. However, your ability to react to that feedback is *inversely correlated* with the number of users. It is not clear to me that there is any optimal spot on this curve where you want to be most responsive.
