Notes:

Which brings us to the nominal subject of the talk, which I'm calling the Stable Interface Paradox, which is my observation that the smaller your user base is, the harder it is to design the right interface, but the larger your user base, the harder it is to change your interface.

This is to say that you can't know what the final product should look like before you get it to your customers, but once you've got it in front of your customers, you can't change it!

Notes:

And of course, what kind of keynote speaker would I be without producing at least one graph with what I'm calling "thought leader axes" — also known as "CEO axes" or "Apple plots" — where the y axis is unlabeled and there are no numbers on the graph anywhere.


But still I do think it's useful to see the principle illustrated — even if the shapes of these curves aren't quite right, I think the general trend is right. You understanding of your problem domain increases as you have more and more users willing to give you feedback about how your product is used in a diverse array of circumstances. However, your ability to react to that feedback is *inversely correlated* with the number of users. It is not clear to me that there is any optimal spot on this curve where you want to be most responsive.
